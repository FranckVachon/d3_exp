D3 fooling around repo
Easy testing/viz on linux: python -m "SimpleHTTPServer" will serve the wd at locahost:8000

For auto-completion: you can get sublime intelisense, and with that you can set:
codeintel_scan_files_in_project to true in the JS section of the sublimecodintel settings - defaults.

Also, to include D3-specific functions in the auto-completion, you can get TernJS pluging (from the package). Then you will be using all project files for auto-completion, including custom functions. You must save your rpoject (Project, save as) to ensure it works (you can save the files this produces anywhere, such as a Sublime project folders eleswhere so it doesn't get synche witht he rest.)
